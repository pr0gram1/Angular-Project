This is a repository that contains Angular examples and a project

## Installing Angular CLI

Install the CLI using the npm package manager:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli

```
## Basic workflow
Invoke the tool on the command line through the ng executable.


```bash
ng help
ng generate --help

```
To create, build, and serve a new, basic Angular project on a development server, go to the parent directory of your new workspace use the following commands:


```bash
ng new my-first-project
cd my-first-project
ng serve

```


## Usage

In your browser, open http://localhost:4200/ to see the new application run. When you use the ng serve command to build an application and serve it locally, the server automatically rebuilds the application and reloads the page when you change any of the source files.
